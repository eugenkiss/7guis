The relevant file to read is in unit1.pas . The rest of the files are generated by lazarus/codetyphon visual editor. 
The typed code in the editor is: 

    inc(Counter);
    Edit1.Caption:=inttostr(Counter);

To test it in Lazarus/CodeTyphon you have to open counter.lpi

The file "counter" (without extension) is a linux64/gtk2 executable, to test if you want. If i have time will make one with fpgui or mse widgetset (that only requires X11).
