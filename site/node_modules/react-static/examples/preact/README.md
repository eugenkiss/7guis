# React-Static - Preact Example

This example of React-Static uses `preact` in production via the use of `preact-compat`. It also includes out of the box:
- Babel
- CSS imports
- Image imports
- File imports
- Automatic Routing

To get started, run `react-static create` and use the `preact` template.
