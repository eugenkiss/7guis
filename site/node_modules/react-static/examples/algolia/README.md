# React-Static - Algolia Example

This example is based on the basic version of react-static, but implements a simple Algolia search.

Included basic react-static features:

* Babel
* CSS imports
* Image imports
* File imports
* Automatic Routing

To get started, run `react-static create` and use the `algolia` template.

To make the search work you'll need to do the following:

* Add your Algolia applicationID & adminApiKey to `algolia.js`
* Add your applicationID & searchOnlyApiKey to `Search.js` container

Algolia CSS styles are @imported in `app.css`.
