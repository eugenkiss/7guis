 ### Is this a bug report?
 
 (write your answer here)
 
 <!--
   If you answered "Yes":
   
     Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you are
     including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.
     
     If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with
     less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.
 
     In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.
 
   If you answered "No":
 
     If this is a question or a discussion, please join the [Slack Channel](https://react-chat-signup.herokuapp.com)
     or post to Stack overflow with the react-static tag.
     
     Note that we only provide help specific to react-static.

 Then, specify:
 
 1. Operating system:
 2. Browser and version (if relevant):
 
 
 ### Steps to Reproduce
 
 <!--
   How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?
   Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.

 ### Expected Behavior
 
 <!--
   How did you expect the tool to behave?
   It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.
   Just write down what you thought would happen.

 (Write what you thought would happen.)
 
 
 ### Actual Behavior
 
 <!--
   Did something go wrong?
   Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?
   Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.

 (Write what happened. Please add screenshots!)
 
 
 ### Reproducible Demo
 
 <!--
   If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.
   This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.
 
   There are two ways to do it:
 
     * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.
       This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.
 
     * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.
       This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.
 
   This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve
   Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:
 -->
 
 (Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)
 
 <!--
   What happens if you skip this step?
   
   We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial
   information is missing. In that case we'll eventually close it if there is no clear direction.
   
   We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might
   create a reproducible example for it.
 
   Thanks for helping us help you!
